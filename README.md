While knowledge is its own reward, it’s not the only one you’ll gain from completing these activities. Every hands-on activity you complete during Superclass improves your chances of winning a super-sweet prize in a drawing at the end of Superclass!

### Deploy CodeExchange Applications
If you’ve used Twilio in the past, chances are you’ve only used one or two different products. If you’ve only sent text messages before, then you don’t know Twilio. One of the best ways to get exposed to new Twilio capabilities is to deploy and test out a sample application on the [Twilio CodeExchange](https://www.twilio.com/code-exchange). Choose a sample application from this repository, and get it running on your own Twilio account.
